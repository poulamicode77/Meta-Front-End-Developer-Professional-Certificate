Task 1: Using the logical && operator
You are coding an RPG game, where each character has certain skill levels based on the value saved in their score.

Create a variable named  score and set it to  8

Use console.log() that includes the string "Mid-level skills:" and compares the score variable to above 0 and below 10 using the && operator

The expected output in the console should be: "Mid-level skills: true".

1 var score = 8;
2 console.log("Mid-level skills:" + (score>0 && score<10));

Note: If the score is set to a value between 1 and 9 (inclusive), the condition evaluates to true. Otherwise, it would evaluate to false.

Task 2: Using the logical || operator
Imagine you are coding a video game. Currently, youâ€™re about to code some snippets related to the game over condition.

You need to code a new variable named timeRemaining and set it to 0. You also need to code a new variable named energy and set it to 10.

Next, you should write a piece of code that could be used to determine if the game is over, based on whether either the value of the timeRemaining variable is 0 or the value of the energy variable is 0.

Complete the task using the following steps:

Declare the variable timeRemaining, and assign the value of 0 to it.

Declare the variable energy, and assign the value of 10 to it.

Console log the following parameters: "Game over: ", and timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0

Note that the expected output in the console should be: "Game over: true".

1 var timeRemaining = 0;
2 var energy = 10;

console.log ("Game over: "+ (timeRemaining == 0 || energy == 0) );

Try changing the timeRemaining variable to anything above 0 and then see how it affects the result.

Note: Logical operators, such as && (AND) and || (OR), allow you to combine multiple conditions to create more complex comparisons.

Task 3: Using the modulus operator, %, to test if a given number is odd
You need to code a small program that takes a number and determines if it's an even number (like 2, 4, 6, 8, 10).

To achieve this task, you need to declare six variables, as follows:

The first variable, named num1,  should be assigned a number value of 2.

The second variable, named num2, should be assigned a number value of 5.

The third variable, named test1, should be assigned the calculation of num1 % 2. Note: executing this code will return a number. Note: The modulus operator % returns the remainder when one number is divided by another. If a number is even, dividing it by 2 will leave no remainder (0).

The fourth variable, named test2, should be assigned the calculation of num2 % 2. Note: executing this code will also return a number.

The fifth variable, named result1, should be assigned the result of checking if the number stored in the test1 variable is  equal to 0, in other words: test1 == 0.

The sixth variable, named result2, should be assigned the result of comparing if the number stored in the test2 variable is equal to 0, in other words, test2 == 0.

Run console log two times after you've set the variables:

The first console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num1, "an even number?", result1

The second console log should have the following code between parentheses: "Is", num2, "an even number?", result2

Note: The output to the console should be as follows:

Is 2 an even number? true

Is 5 an even number? false

1 var num1 = 2;
2 var num2 = 5;
3 var test1 = num1 % 2;
4 var test2 = num2 % 2;
5 var result1 = test1 == 0;
6 var result2 = test2 == 0;
7 console.log ("Is", num1, "an even number?", result1);
8 console.log ("Is", num2, "an even number?", result2)

Try it yourself with different values to explore the modulus operator.

Task 4: Add numbers using the + operator
Console log the result of adding two numbers, 5 and 10, using the + operator.

Note: This task should be completed on a single line of code. The output in the console should be 15.

1 console.log (5+10);

Task 5: Concatenate numbers and strings using the + operator
Code three variables:

The first variable should be a string with the following value: "Now in ". Name the variable now.

The second variable should be a number with the value: 3. Name the variable three.

The third variable should a string with the following value: "D!". Name the variable d.

Console log the following code: now + three + d.

Note: The expected output should be: "Now in 3D!".

1 var now = "Now in ";
2 var three = 3;
3 var d = "D!";
4 console.log(now + three + d);

Task 6: Use the += operator to accumulate values in a variable
Code a new variable and name it counter, assigning it to the value of 0.

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 5.

On the next line, use the += operator to increase the value of counter by 3.

On the fourth line, console log the value of the counter variable.

Note: The output value should be 8.

1 var counter = 0;
2 counter+= 5;
3 counter+= 3;
4 console.log (counter);
