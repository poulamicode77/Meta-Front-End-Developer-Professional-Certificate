Exercise: Creating arrays and objects
In this exercise lab you will practice creating arrays and objects.

Tasks to complete
Create a new empty array literal and assign it to the variable clothes.

Add 5 of your favorite items of clothing as strings using the push() method.

Remove the fifth piece of clothing from the array using the pop() method.

Add a new piece of clothing using the push() method.

Use console.log to show the third item from the clothes array in the console.

Create a new empty object literal and assign it to the variable favCar.

Using the dot notation, assign a color property to the favCar object and give it a string value with the color of your choice.

Using the dot notation, assign a convertible property to the favCar object and give it a boolean value of your choice.

Use the console to log the entire favCar object.

var clothes = [];
clothes.push("shirt","top","jeans","dress","sweater")
clothes.pop()
clothes.push("trouser")
console.log (clothes);
Note:  In Step2, the push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. For example: 
var favCar ={};
favCar.color = "Black";
favCar.covertible = true;
console.log(favCar);

Note:  In Step2, the push() method adds one or more elements to the end of an array and returns the new length of the array. For example: 

let arr = [1, 2];
arr.push(3); // Adds 3 to the end
console.log(arr); // [1, 2, 3]
